Right-hand Side is a Chrome extension that integrates contents from different sources (e.g. Wikipedia, Wolfram Alpha, Twitter) into Google search results.

All the contents are located at the right-hand side of the Google results page (that's where the extension name comes from), and have the same UI as Google's own [Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph) results to create a unified and consistent user experience.

## Usage
It's quite simple! Just google any keyword as you normally would, and the results will appear at the right-hand side.

Below is an example:
